I made this repository to be able to skip the boring part of D2 with a Mac. Each folder contains the 4 required filetypes for each character class.

How to use:
=============



Mac:
---------------

1. Choose a character you want to start, and copy the 4 files for that character (.d2s, .key, .ma0, .map) from this repository into your Saves folder.

2. If you want all the characters, save the files from the 'all' folder into your Saves folder.

(On my Mac, the path for character Saves is New Finder Window > Applications > Diablo II > Save).


Windows Users:
---------------

If you use Windows, you can copy files from this repository to your Saves folder and that should work fine. However, on Windows you can easily replicate the same effect by just typing a few letters.

From the instructions at https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/370600-diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction/cheats :
1. Right click the desktop icon for D2 and click 'Properties'.

2. Click the 'Shortcut' tab.

3. In 'Target:', you should see something like '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\Diablo II.exe"'. Keep this and just add ' -act5' next to it. This will make it so that every time you create a new character in D2, you'll start at level 33 in Act 5.

4. If you don't have the expansion, add ' -act4' instead and you'll start as a level 27 blank character in Act 4.


Renaming a character:
---------------
 1. Go to the saves folder that contains your character.

 2. Find the 4 files that contain that character's name. The file extensions are .d2s, .key, .ma0, and .map

 3. For each file, Right-click or Command-click the file and click 'Rename'.

 4. Rename the character to whatever you want, making sure that all 4 names match, and that you kept all the file extensions.

 Then your character's new name should show up in the game next time it runs.
