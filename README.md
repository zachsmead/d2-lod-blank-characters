I made this repository so people can skip the boring part of D2 if they use a Mac. Each folder contains the 4 required filetypes for each character class.

How to use:

1. Choose a character you want to start, and save its 4 files from this repository into your Saves folder.

2. If you want all the characters, save the files from the 'all' folder into your Saves folder.

(On my Mac, the path for character Saves is New Finder Window > Applications > Diablo II > Save).


Windows Users:

3. If you use Windows, you can copy files from this repository to your Saves folder and it will work fine. However, you can easily replicate the same effect by just typing a letters.

From the instructions at https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/370600-diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction/cheats:
	- Right click the desktop icon for D2 and click 'Properties'.
	- Click the 'Shortcut' tab.
	- In 'Target:', you should see something like '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\Diablo II.exe"'. Keep this and just add ' -act5' next to it. This will make it so that every time you create a new character in D2, you'll start as a level 33 blank character in Act 5.
	- If you don't have LoD, add ' -act4' instead and you'll start as a level 27 blank character in Act 4.
